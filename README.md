# Quantum Implementation and Analysis of ARIA 

This repository contains the relevant codes for the paper : 
- Depth-Optimized Quantum Implementation of ARIA  - the paper by Yang et al. 
- Quantum Implementation and Analysis of ARIA - accepted in SVCC'24


The file with _Yang is the ICISC'23 paper code. The old version uses PLU for linear operations, and new version uses XZLBZ for linear operations.

The file with _naive is the final version code of SVCC'24. This code uses the out-of-place method for linear operations and Boyar-Peralta method (bit slicing) for S1.
